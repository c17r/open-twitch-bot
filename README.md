# Open Twitch Bot
A Twitch bot built using Node.js

## Setup
Run 'npm install' within the project directory to install all required node modules
Change directories to './node_modules/chalk/' and run 'npm install'

Copy personal.js.example to personal.js and fill in the details using your Twitch information.
Don't worry personal.js will not be committed, it is included in the .gitignore file.

## Running the bot
Run 'node app.js' from within the project directory

## Notes
Still a work in progress.
